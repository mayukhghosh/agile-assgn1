[Companies are making up for lack of cybersecurity professionals by investing in their developers](https://sdtimes.com/security/companies-are-making-up-for-lack-of-cybersecurity-professionals-by-investing-in-their-developers/).

##### Response

This article sheds light on developers’ rising concerns for security. As we are constantly seeing, software and services are being hacked daily through uncaught vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, while the concern is increasing, the number of cybersecurity engineers has not. I have always been interested in cybersecurity, and I was hoping to take a course on it as one of my CS electives, but there are none on the topic - at least in CAS. One might assume that the lack of cybersecurity professionals might have something to do with their schooling. Although I’m interested in it, I would never be hired for a cybersecurity position, because I have no experience. But unless I’m taught, that can never change. I hope schools start teaching cybersecurity, because the demand is only going to keep increasing.

That ratio of 1 security engineer to 100 regular developers is quite stark indeed. It's all the more concerning when one ponders the considerations for national security, as cyber warfare has arguably surpassed traditional warfare in many ways. Perhaps the governemnt will realize that there is an impetus to accelerate the number of entrants into the field and create some incentive(s) as such.
